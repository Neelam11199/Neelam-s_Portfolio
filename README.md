# [1. Project on Online Book Store](https://github.com/Neelam11199/SQL-Project-on-Online-Book-store)

* Data Source: The dataset used for this project was obtained from publicly available Google search data.

* Data Model: The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) includes three tables: Orders, Customers, and Books.

* Schema Design: The Orders table serves as the fact table, while Customers and Books act as dimension tables within the star schema model.

* [Analysis: The file provided below contains a set of analytical questions that have been answered using MySQL Workbench](https://github.com/Neelam11199/SQL-Project-on-Online-Book-store/blob/main/SQL%20Project%20Questions%20Day%2030.pdf)

# [2. Project on SQL Music Store Analysis](https://github.com/Neelam11199/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis)

* Data Source: The dataset used for this project was obtained from Someonce Github.

* [ Model: The Entity-Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/Neelam11199/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis/blob/main/MusicDatabaseSchema.png)

* [The Project Write up is linked](https://github.com/Neelam11199/SQL_Music_Store_Analysis/blob/main/Project%20Write%20Up%20_%F0%9F%8E%B5%20Music%20Store%20Database.pdf)

# [3. Project on SQL Booking.com](https://github.com/Neelam11199/Booking.com-Project) 

* [Data Source:] The dataset used for this project was obtained from publicly available hotel booking data sourced via Google search.(https://github.com/Neelam11199/Booking.com-Project/blob/main/booking_Dataset.csv)

* Data Model: The analysis is based on a single bookings table, transformed into a clean, deduplicated view (booking_view) for reliable insight generation.

* Schema Design: Although based on a flat file, the project emulates a dimensional model where attributes like market_segment, hotel, and country act as dimensions for slicing insights.

*  Analysis: The SQL script answers key business questions using advanced SQL queries, including CTEs, aggregations, and date-based analysis, executed in PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible syntax.

*  Project Assets:
